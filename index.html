        <h4>Hello, World</h4>
        <div>
          <p>Hello, my name is Nathan Patterson and I'm studying Management of Information Systems. This year I'll be a junior at UNO.</p>
          <img src="./images/uno.png" height="150" width="150">
          <p>Once I graduate I'm hoping to eventually get into the field of networking and help my girlfriend open a bakery. She's going to school for a baking degree so whenever we're together we'll usually try and bake something. It's not always perfect, but we have fun. Otherwise between my job, church, and school I don't have all that much free time anymore, but when I do get the chance I'll read some comics, watch cartoons, or play Mario Kart.</p>

        <h4>New School Year</h4>
        <div>
          <p>2019 brings a new school year and with that comes another set of classes and assignments. I have math, english, and other general education courses this semester, however I also have a Web Applications course which I am very excited about. I can't wait to learn how to develop web applications in a more professional manner.</p>
